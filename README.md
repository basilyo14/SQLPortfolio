# Nathan Cabero's SQL Portfolio
This is where I will be storing my SQL Projects

Current SQL Projects listed in this repository:
  1. ValorantQuery: This was my first project using SQL and wanted to showcase different skills I picked up when learning SQL. Using this dataset, I wanted to compare 
     all the different regions within Riot Games and see which region could be considered the best region (Using their best players, from Rank Immortal 1 to Radiant)  
 
  2. TaylorRusswoleQuery: This was another project using SQL where I used SQL to analyse the data and only pick out data that I would need for my visualization, which        can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nathan.roby.cabero/viz/AtwoodvsRusswoleComparison/Dashboard1). This project was simply just analyzing the      differences between the two lifters and how their performances differ from one another in USAPL Meets.
