# Nathan Cabero's SQL Portfolio
This is where I will be storing my SQL Projects

Current SQL Projects listed in this repository:
  1. ValorantQuery: This was my first project using SQL and wanted to showcase different skills I picked up when learning SQL. Using this dataset, I wanted to compare 
     all the different regions within Riot Games and see which region could be considered the best region (Using their best players, from Rank Immortal 1 to Radiant)
